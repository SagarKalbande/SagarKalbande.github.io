      <p class="text-justify">I am Sagar Kalbande. A geek by mind and a dancer by body is how you can describe me. I completed my Graduation as well as Post Graduation from the department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. From the past 1 year I am working as a Graphics Engineer at VizExperts. The idea of creating a completely new virtual world where you can experience what you can never feel in real life, is what got me most attracted towards this field. My work revolves around applications that use the virtual world to solve real life problems.</p>

>>>>>>> changed a lot!
      <p class="text-justify">Worked as one of the lead developers for building a VR based training solution for the Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE), Chandigarh. The solution simulates the actual mountainous terrain in a virtual environment, for the benefit of enhancing the training methods of the personnel. The terrain in question is deadly, with risks of snow related accidents and potential avalanches that can trigger without warning. The solution is designed in such a way that a person gradually learns to deal with these situations in a risk free setting. The best part is that the trainer can see and monitor the performance of the trainee. Based on the actions taken by the trainee in the virtual environment, their skill level can be mapped.</p>

      <p class="text-justify">Handling a derailed crane in order to place it back on track is a long procedure. At VizExperts, I had the opportunity to work as the Lead Developer for this POC. Railway Crane Simulator is a multiplayer VR Simulation where players can join collaboratively and operate to place a derailed train bogie back on track. It demonstrates the protocol that is essential for executing the process. The crane can be controlled using a Physical Joystick. This makes the player give a higher level of immersion that makes his feel as if he is operating the crane physically. This application was built on Unreal Engine.</p>

After the simulation is run, the solider would follow the shortest path to get to the victim. This application was made using Unreal Engine. The next milestones in this application would be to give weights to different paths and make the soldier traverse accordingly.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">Sniper Deployer is a VR POC (proof of concept) that I created to showcase the potential of VR in Tackling terrorist ambush. The player can teleport himself to various building tops and deploy snipers. The application can then be used to identify blind spots for the sniper cell. It can be used to map the best possible sniper placement arrangement so that most of the area could be covered with least number of blind spots. This application was made using Unreal Engine</p>

          <p class="text-justify">Bubble Burst is a gamified application that uses the Audio Library of Unity3d. The player has a blowing straw in one hand and a chinese fan in the other hand. The application detects the player voice intensity and forms bubble when the player blows. The player can then use the chinese fan to move the bubbles. The bubbles can be blown towards the butterflies to catch them.<p>

          <p class="text-justify">Since the beginning of Video Games, procedural generation has been used by developers to make their games more random, realistic and light weighted. When your game relies on algorithms to create stuff, minor tweaking in the parameters can cause huge changes. I was inspired to make something procedurally and hence here is my attempt on it.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">Electric overhead travelling (EOT) crane is associated with complex operational activities such as loading and unloading in manufacturing industry. Training to operators in real scenario is not possible because of these complex activities and the risk associated with the operation. It may also hamper the manufacturing process of the organization. This study aimed at developing a virtual prototype-based EOT crane simulator that can be used for providing training to the operators</p>
