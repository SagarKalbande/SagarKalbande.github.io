      <h3>The summary of my story</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">I am Sagar Kalbande. A geek by mind and a dancer by body is how you can describe me. I completed my Graduation as well as Post Graduation from the department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. From the past 1 year I am working as a Graphics Engineer at VizExperts. The idea of creating a completely new virtual world where you can experience what you can never feel in real life, is what got me most attracted towards this field. My work revolves around applications that use the virtual world to solve real life problems.</p>

      <h3>My work at VizExperts</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">At VizExperts I have worked on developing Virtual Reality Simulator for Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) India. I have also developed many quick prototypes to showcase the power of VR in different areas including Warehouse Management, Rail Accidents, and  Tackling Terrorist Ambush</p>

      <img class="img-responsive" src="SASE.jpg" class="img-rounded" alt="SASE">
      <p class="text-justify">Worked as one of the lead developers for building a VR based training solution for the Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE), Chandigarh. The solution simulates the actual mountainous terrain in a virtual environment, for the benefit of enhancing the training methods of the personnel. The terrain in question is deadly, with risks of snow related accidents and potential avalanches that can trigger without warning. The solution is designed in such a way that a person gradually learns to deal with these situations in a risk free setting. The best part is that the trainer can see and monitor the performance of the trainee. Based on the actions taken by the trainee in the virtual environment, their skill level can be mapped.</p>

      <h3>Railway Crane Simulator</h3>
      <p>Handling a derailed crane in order to place it back on track is a long procedure. At VizExperts, I had the opportunity to work as the Lead Developer for this POC. Railway Crane Simulator is a multiplayer VR Simulation where players can join collaboratively and operate to place a derailed train bogie back on track. It demonstrates the protocol that is essential for executing the process. The crane can be controlled using a Physical Joystick. This makes the player give a higher level of immersion that makes his feel as if he is operating the crane physically. This application was built on Unreal Engine.</p>

        <h3>Rescue Path-Finder</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">Rescue Path-Finder is a Desktop Simulation Application where the user can place a solider at a location, and a victim at another location. After the simulation is run, the solider would follow the shortest path to get to the victim. This application was made using Unreal Engine. The next milestones in this application would be to give weights to different paths and make the soldier traverse accordingly.</p>

        <h3>Sniper Deployer</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">Sniper Deployer is a VR POC (proof of concept) that I created to showcase the potential of VR in Tackling terrorist ambush. The player can teleport himself to various building tops and deploy snipers. The application can then be used to identify blind spots for the sniper cell. It can be used to map the best possible sniper placement arrangement so that most of the area could be covered with least number of blind spots. This application was made using Unreal Engine</p>

        <h3>Workplace Augmented Reality</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">Developed an augumented reality application that renders a revolving globe with the company name over the Visiting Cards of all the employees. These applications would be an effective marketing strategy for the company. This app was made using Vuforia and Unity3d. I would be soon adding better interactions to this application.</p>

          <h3>VR Bubble Burst</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">Bubble Burst is a gamified application that uses the Audio Library Unity3d. The player has a blowing straw in one hand and a chinese fan in the other hand. The application detects the player voice intensity and forms bubble when the player blows. The player can then use the chinese fan to move the bubbles. The game level is a low poly garden where butterflies fly. The bubbles can be blown towards the butterflies to catch them. This application can be used as an effective stress reliever.<p>

          <h3>Procedural Pacman</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">Since the beginning of Video Games, procedural generation has been used by developers to make their games more random, realistic and light weighted. When your game relies on algorithms to create stuff, minor tweaking in the parameters can cause huge changes. The game 'No Man's Sky' is an excellent example of using this technique. Here is the youtube link to the animals that this game generated. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=059vo1uGjLQ. I was inspired to make something procedurally and hence here is my attempt on it. This game has a pacman like gameplay, there are AIs in the game, that move in grids. The player dies when it touches the AI. The specialty of this game is that each new level one plays is procedural generated. The Movement of AIs, the number of coins, the number of AIs, their placement etc changes with slight parameter changes. This is just a small attempt at procedural generation.</p>

          <h3>Balance the drunk guy</h3>
          <p>Balance the drunk guy is a fun to play phyiscs based 2D platformer which I made as a gift for my friend. The character of this game has wheels attached to his legs. The bone physics of this game make it fun to play. The aim is to control the wheels and prevent the character from falling. This project was made using Unity3D.</p>

            <h3>The Indian Flappy Chicken</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">>In the process of learning to Develop Games, I stumbled upon another algorithmic way of generating games, which is used in Infinite runners like Temple Run, Subway Surfer, Flappy Bird and many others like them! Here is my attempt to recreate Flappy Bird with a pinch of my own thoughts! :) Try the PC version here: https://sagarkalbande.itch.io/flappychick</p>
