I completed my Graduation as well as Post Graduation from the department of <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/IM">Industrial and Systems Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/">IIT Kharagpur</a>. From the past 1 year I am working as a Graphics Engineer at <a href="https://www.vizexperts.com/">VizExperts</a>, a Delhi based company working in developing solutions in the fields of <b>Geospatial Intelligence, Professional AV, Virtual Reality and Simulation</b>. The idea of creating a completely new virtual world where you can experience what you can never feel in real life, is what got me most attracted towards this field. My work revolves around applications that use the virtual world to solve real life problems.</p>

The terrain is generated from real life data. Various events can be triggerd without warning so that the person gradually learns to deal with these situations in a risk free setting. The best part is that the trainer can see and monitor the performance of the trainee. Based on the actions taken by the trainee in the virtual environment, their skill level can be mapped.
