      <h3>The summary of my story</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">I am Sagar Kalbande. A geek by mind and a dancer by body is how you can describe me. I completed my Graduation as well as Post Graduation from the department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. From the past 1 year I am working as a Graphics Engineer at VizExperts. The idea of creating a completely new virtual world where you can experience what you can never feel in real life, is what got me most attracted towards this field. My work revolves around applications that use the virtual world to solve real life problems.</p>

      <h3>My work at VizExperts</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">At VizExperts I have worked on developing Virtual Reality Simulator for Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) India. I have also developed many quick prototypes to showcase the power of VR in different areas including Warehouse Management, Rail Accidents, and  Tackling Terrorist Ambush</p>

      <img class="img-responsive" src="SASE.jpg" class="img-rounded" alt="SASE">
      <p class="text-justify">Worked as one of the lead developers for building a VR based training solution for the Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE), Chandigarh. The solution simulates the actual mountainous terrain in a virtual environment, for the benefit of enhancing the training methods of the personnel. The terrain in question is deadly, with risks of snow related accidents and potential avalanches that can trigger without warning. The solution is designed in such a way that a person gradually learns to deal with these situations in a risk free setting. The best part is that the trainer can see and monitor the performance of the trainee. Based on the actions taken by the trainee in the virtual environment, their skill level can be mapped.</p>

        <h3>Sniper Deployer</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">Sniper Deployer is a VR POC (proof of concept) that I created to showcase the potential of VR in Tackling terrorist ambush. The player can teleport himself to various building tops and deploy snipers. The application can then be used to identify blind spots for the sniper cell. It can be used to map the best possible sniper placement arrangement so that most of the area could be covered with least number of blind spots.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">Developed an augumented reality application that renders a revolving globe with the company name over the Visiting Cards of all the employees. These applications would be an effective marketing strategy for the company. This app was made using Vuforia and Unity3d. I would be soon adding better interactions to this application.</p>
